# Motivation

The motivation for this repository is to be used as a demonstration of TDD. The step-by-step will be done onsite, but I would try to replicate the same behavior using commit log.

The Fibonacci sequence was chosen, because of the simplicity of implementing it.

## Fibonacci sequence

The *Fibonacci sequence* is a series of numbers where a numbers is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
Starting with 0 and 1, the sequence goes 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, â€¦

x<sub>n</sub> = x<sub>n-1</sub> + x<sub>n-2</sub>

## Three rules of TDD by Uncle Bob

- Write no production code, expect to pass a failing test
- Write only enough of a test to demostrate a failure
- Write only enough production code to pass a test

Happy coding!
